The code in this repo that actually decrypts the QR code data is just [cabrower's python decryption script](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/brmesh-app-bluetooth-lights/473486/122) ([which is actually just converted C# code](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/brmesh-app-bluetooth-lights/473486/115)) converted to JS.
